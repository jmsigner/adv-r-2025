This time, I will talk about good practice R coding and give you some
practical tips that help you keep your coding projects clean,
reproducible and reusable.

Below this email, you can find more information on the topic and a

*Title: *Write R code that lasts: Practical tips for reproducible data
analysis.

*Abstract: *Do your R projects sometimes get messy, your scripts grow
out of control, or your results are hard to reproduce? In this lecture,
I?ll share practical tips for setting up clean, maintainable, and
reproducible data analysis projects. We?ll cover how to structure
projects, organize scripts, write good-practice code, and manage
dependencies effectively. The focus is on realistic practices that make
your code easier for others ? and your future self ? to understand and
reuse.
While the examples will use R, many of the tips apply to anyone doing
data analysis, also in other languages. Whether you?re just starting out
or already experienced with R, this session will help you build better
habits for writing clean, reusable code.

*When? *Thursday, May 15th 3-4 p.m.
*Where? *Online on Webex
